For better experience and true color support use neovide, you can install it easly on arch based distros running the following command
```bash
sudo pacman -S neovide
```
## 2
I'm still new for GitHub and even configuring so my configs won't be perfect I'm looking forward for lots of issues

## 3
The configurations primary are likely spagitti and the well configured programming languages are C and C++

I'll try my beset to enhance the configurations more and make it better in the future, glad to get your support:)
